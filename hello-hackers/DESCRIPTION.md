So now you've written your first x86 assembly program!
In this module, we'll write a more complex one: something that writes text to the screen!
This is going to be an exciting journey: the logic of this program is going to be both as close as you can possibly get to the hardware itself (e.g., you are writing raw x86 assembly that the CPU directly understands!) and as close as you can possibly get to the Linux operating system (e.g., you are triggering system calls directly!).
