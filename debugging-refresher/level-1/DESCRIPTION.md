This level gets you re-familiarized with gdb.
To get started with this level, and all the other levels of this module, run `/challenge/embryogdb_levelXYZ`, where XYZ is the level number.
That program will launch `gdb`.
Run the actual level logic with `r`, and follow the prompts to get that flag!

**RELEVANT DOCUMENTATION:**
This level uses the [`run`](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb#Starting) and [`continue`](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb#Continuing-and-Stepping) commands in gdb.
