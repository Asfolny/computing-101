To enable your server to handle several clients at once, you will introduce concurrency using the `fork` syscall.
When a client connects, `fork` creates a child process dedicated to handling that connection.
Meanwhile, the parent process immediately returns to accept additional connections.
With this design, the child uses `read` and `write` to interact with the client, while the parent continues to listen.
This concurrent model is a key concept in building scalable, real-world servers.
