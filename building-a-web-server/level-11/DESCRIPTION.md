In the final challenge, your server must seamlessly support both GET and POST requests within a single program.
After reading the incoming request using `read`, your server will inspect the first few characters to determine whether it is dealing with a GET or a POST.
Depending on the request type, it will process the data accordingly and then send back an appropriate response using `write`.
Throughout this process, `fork` is employed to handle each connection concurrently, ensuring that your server can manage multiple requests at the same time.
After completing this, you will have built a simple, but fully functional, web server capable of handling different types of HTTP requests.
